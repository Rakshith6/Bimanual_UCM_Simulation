# Bimanual_UCM_Simulation
Identifying actions belonging to the Uncontrolled Manifold for bimanual manipulation of a cursor. The cursor is placed at the average position of the two hands forming a redundant system. 
The code learns to perform actions that ensure stability of the cursor i.e. learns actions in the null space of the redundant system. The epsilon greedy strategy is used to ensure adequate exploration.
